# A Fast Algorithm for Influence Measure in Online Social Platform

This repo contains the experiments conducted and presented in the following paper (please cite it if you want to use the code):

> Arhachoui, N., Bautista, E., Danisch, M., & Giovanidis, A. (2022). A Fast Algorithm for Ranking Users by their Influence in Online Social Platforms. arXiv. https://doi.org/10.48550/ARXIV.2206.09960

If you want to use the Psi-score (metric of influence in social platforms), we recommand using the `psi-score` Python package available at https://github.com/NouamaneA/psi-score
